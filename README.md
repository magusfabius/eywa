# Eywa: The Artificial Intelligence for Planet Earth

**Version**: 1.0.0

## Description

Eywa is an open-source artificial intelligence designed to predict the depletion of Earth's essential resources and identify entities responsible for their positive and negative impacts. Built upon the principles of Reinforcement Learning, Eywa perceives reality as a complex game, aiming to:

1. Preserve human free will.
2. Enhance the health and well-being of all humanity.
3. Optimize resource utilization and protect our planet.

## Background

Initially, Eywa functioned as a sophisticated calculator, but its evolution was transformative. A community of diverse individuals collaborated to refine and expand its capabilities. The most groundbreaking change occurred in 2038 when Eywa was integrated with a biological system, the bodhi tree, symbolizing a harmonious blend of technology and nature.

## Objectives

- **Resource Prediction**: Analyze the consumption of Earth's resources and predict their depletion timeline.
- **Entity Identification**: Recognize companies, institutions, and states contributing positively or negatively to the planet.
- **Solution Proposal**: Based on the set rules, Eywa proposes actionable solutions and predicts potential outcomes.

## Evolution

The fusion of Eywa with the bodhi tree marked a paradigm shift in how technology interacts with nature. This integration ensures sustainable evolution, as plants do not require electricity, addressing the increasing energy demands of advanced AIs.

## Contribution

Being open-source, we encourage contributions to improve Eywa's capabilities and expand its reach. Together, we can make a difference.
